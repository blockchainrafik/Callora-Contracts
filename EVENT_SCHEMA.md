# Event Schema

Events emitted by all Callora contracts for indexers, frontends, and auditors.
All topic/data types refer to Soroban/Stellar XDR values.

## Change Note (2026-04)

The `workspace-members-dedup` hardening patch does not introduce event additions, removals, or payload shape changes.

## Contract: Callora Vault

### `init`

Emitted once when the vault is initialized.

| Index   | Location | Type    | Description         |
|---------|----------|---------|---------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol  | `"init"`            |
| topic 1 | topics   | Address | vault owner         |
| data    | data     | i128    | initial balance     |

```json
{
  "topics": ["init", "GOWNER..."],
  "data": 1000000
}
```

---

### `deposit`

Emitted when a depositor increases the vault balance.

| Index   | Location | Type         | Description                   |
|---------|----------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol       | `"deposit"`                   |
| topic 1 | topics   | Address      | caller (depositor)            |
| data    | data     | (i128, i128) | (amount, new_balance)         |

```json
{
  "topics": ["deposit", "GDEPOSITOR..."],
  "data": [500000, 1500000]
}
```

---

### `deduct`

Emitted on each deduction â€” once per `deduct()` call and once per item in `batch_deduct()`.

| Index   | Location | Type         | Description                                    |
|---------|----------|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol       | `"deduct"`                                     |
| topic 1 | topics   | Address      | caller                                         |
| topic 2 | topics   | Symbol       | `request_id` (empty Symbol if not provided)    |
| data    | data     | (i128, i128) | (amount, new_balance)                          |

```json
{
  "topics": ["deduct", "GCALLER...", "req_abc123"],
  "data": [100000, 900000]
}
```

**`request_id` encoding (indexer contract):**

- **Topic is always present**: the vault always emits **exactly 3 topics** for `deduct`.
- **No optional topic**: Soroban events do not carry an `Option` topic value; instead the vault uses a **sentinel**.
- **Sentinel for â€œno request_idâ€**: when the input `request_id` is `None`, topic 2 is `Symbol("")` (an empty symbol).
- **Indexer rule**: treat `Symbol("")` as â€œno request_id providedâ€.
- **Ambiguity note**: `Some(Symbol(""))` is indistinguishable from `None` on-chain. Clients **SHOULD NOT** intentionally pass an empty symbol as a real request id.

**Precondition (Issue #263):** `deduct` / `batch_deduct` require a settlement
address to be configured via `set_settlement`. If the settlement address is
not set, the call panics with `"settlement address not set"` **before** any
`deduct` event is emitted â€” indexers will therefore never observe a `deduct`
event for a call that lacked a configured settlement destination.

**Idempotency guard (Issue #249):** when `request_id` is `Some(Symbol)`, the
value is single-use across successful `deduct` and `batch_deduct` calls.
Reusing a previously accepted value, or repeating the same value twice inside
one batch, panics with `"duplicate request_id"` before any balance update,
transfer, or `deduct` event is emitted.

### `withdraw`

Emitted when the vault owner withdraws to their own address.

```json
{
  "topics": ["admin_nominated", "GADMIN...", "GNOMINEE..."],
  "data": null
}
```

---

### `admin_accepted`

- **OwnershipTransfer**: not present in current vault; would list old_owner, new_owner.

---

### `vault_paused`

Emitted when the vault circuit-breaker is activated by admin or owner.

| Field   | Location | Type    | Description                                      |
|---------|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol  | `"vault_paused"`                                 |
| topic 1 | topics   | Address | `caller` â€” admin or owner who triggered pause   |
| data    | data     | ()      | empty                                            |

**Indexer Note:** After this event is emitted, `is_paused()` view function returns `true`.
The following operations are blocked until unpause: `deposit()`, `deduct()`, `batch_deduct()`.

---

### `vault_unpaused`

Emitted when the vault circuit-breaker is deactivated by admin or owner.

| Field   | Location | Type    | Description                                      |
|---------|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol  | `"vault_unpaused"`                               |
| topic 1 | topics   | Address | `caller` â€” admin or owner who triggered unpause |
| data    | data     | ()      | empty                                            |

**Indexer Note:** After this event is emitted, `is_paused()` view function returns `false`.
All vault operations are restored: `deposit()`, `deduct()`, `batch_deduct()`.

---

### View Function: `is_paused()`

The vault exposes a read-only view function for off-chain systems to query the current pause state.

**Signature:** `pub fn is_paused(env: Env) -> bool`

**Return Value:**
- `true` â€” Vault is currently paused (circuit-breaker active)
- `false` â€” Vault is operational (normal state)

**Safety Guarantees:**
- **Read-only**: No state mutation or side effects
- **Deterministic**: Identical state always produces identical output
- **Non-panicking**: Never panics, even before initialization
- **Safe default**: Returns `false` when pause state is unset

**Indexer Usage:**
```javascript
// Check if vault is paused before processing transactions
const isPaused = await vault.isPaused();
if (isPaused) {
  // Vault is paused - deposits and deductions are blocked
  // Only admin/owner operations like withdraw() are allowed
} else {
  // Vault is operational - all functions available
}
```

**Consistency with Events:**
- `vault_paused` event emitted â†’ `is_paused()` returns `true`
- `vault_unpaused` event emitted â†’ `is_paused()` returns `false`

Indexers should use `is_paused()` for current state queries and subscribe to
`vault_paused`/`vault_unpaused` events for state change notifications.

```json
{
  "topics": ["set_revenue_pool", "GADMIN..."],
  "data": "GPOOL..."
}
```

---

### `clear_revenue_pool`

}
```

---

### `metadata_set`

| Index   | Location | Type    | Description               |
|---------|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol  | `"metadata_set"`          |
| topic 1 | topics   | String  | offering_id               |
| topic 2 | topics   | Address | caller (owner)            |
| data    | data     | String  | metadata (IPFS CID / URI) |

| Index   | Location | Type             | Description                    |
|---------|----------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol           | `"metadata_updated"`           |

| topic 2 | topics   | Address          | caller (owner)                 |
| data    | data     | (String, String) | (old_metadata, new_metadata)   |

```json
{
  "topics": ["metadata_updated", "offering-001", "GOWNER..."],
  "data": ["ipfs://old...", "ipfs://new..."]
}
```

---

### `metadata_removed`

Emitted when the owner deletes a stale offering's metadata from instance storage.

| Index   | Location | Type    | Description         |

```json
{
  "topics": ["metadata_removed", "offering-001", "GOWNER..."],
  "data": null
}
```

**Indexer note:** After this event, `get_metadata(offering_id)` returns `None`.
The call is idempotent — removing a key that was never set (or was already removed)
emits the event and returns `Ok(())` without error.

---

### `set_authorized_caller`

Emitted when the owner updates the authorized caller address.

| Index   | Location | Type                              | Description                                  |

## Contract: `callora-revenue-pool` (v0.0.1)

The revenue pool receives USDC forwarded by the vault on every `deduct` / `batch_deduct`
call and lets the admin distribute those funds to developers.

### `init`

Emitted once when the revenue pool is initialized.

| data    | data     | Address | `usdc_token` â€” token contract address|

```json
{
  "topics": ["init", "GADMIN..."],
  "data": "GUSDC_TOKEN..."
}
```

> **Security note:** `usdc_token` is immutable after `init`. Verify it matches the
> canonical Stellar USDC contract before deployment.

---

### `admin_transfer_started`

Emitted when the current admin nominates a successor (step 1 of 2).

| Index   | Location | Type    | Description                              |

```json
{
  "topics": ["admin_transfer_started", "GCURRENT_ADMIN..."],
  "data": "GPENDING_ADMIN..."
}
```

> Indexers should treat funds as still under `current_admin` control until
> `admin_transfer_completed` is observed.

---

### `admin_changed`

Emitted when `set_admin()` is called to record the requested admin change.
This event is emitted immediately before `admin_transfer_started`.

| Index   | Location | Type               | Description                           |
|---------|----------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|

| data    | data     | (Address, Address) | `(old_admin, new_admin)`              |

```json
{
  "topics": ["admin_changed", "GCURRENT_ADMIN..."],

```json
{
  "topics": ["admin_transfer_completed", "GNEW_ADMIN..."],
  "data": null
}
```

> After this event, only `new_admin` can call `distribute`, `batch_distribute`,
> `receive_payment`, and `set_admin`.

---

### `receive_payment`

Emitted when the admin logs an inbound payment from the vault.

> **Note:** This is an **event-only helper** â€” it does not move tokens. USDC
> arrives via a direct token transfer from the vault. Call `receive_payment` to
> emit this event for indexer alignment.

| Index   | Location | Type         | Description                                     |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol       | `"receive_payment"`                             |
| topic 1 | topics   | Address      | `caller` â€” typically admin                      |
| data    | data     | (i128, bool) | `(amount, from_vault)` â€” amount in stroops; `from_vault=true` when source is the vault |

```json
{
  "topics": ["receive_payment", "GADMIN..."],
  "data": [5000000, true]
}
```

**Example â€” manual top-up (not from vault):**

```json
{
  "topics": ["receive_payment", "GADMIN..."],
  "data": [1000000, false]
}
```

> Indexers tracking total inflows should subscribe to this event and filter on
> `from_vault` to distinguish vault-originated payments from manual top-ups.

---

### `distribute`

Emitted when the admin distributes USDC to a single developer.

| Index   | Location | Type    | Description              |
|---------|----------|---------|--------------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol  | `"distribute"`           |
| topic 1 | topics   | Address | `to` â€” developer address |
| data    | data     | i128    | `amount` in stroops      |

```json
{
  "topics": ["distribute", "GDEVELOPER..."],
  "data": 2500000
}
```

> A `distribute` event guarantees the token transfer succeeded â€” the USDC has
> left the pool contract and arrived at `to`.

---

### `set_max_distribute`

Emitted when the admin updates the per-leg distribution cap.

| Index   | Location | Type    | Description                    |

| data    | data     | (i128, i128) | `(old_max, new_max)`       |

```json
{
  "topics": ["set_max_distribute", "GADMIN..."],
  "data": [9223372036854775807, 500]
}
```

---

### `batch_distribute`

Emitted **once per payment** during a `batch_distribute()` call. If a batch has
three payments, three `batch_distribute` events are emitted in order.

| Index   | Location | Type    | Description              |
|---------|----------|---------|--------------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol  | `"batch_distribute"`     |
| topic 1 | topics   | Address | `to` â€” developer address |
| data    | data     | i128    | `amount` in stroops      |

```json
{
  "topics": ["batch_distribute", "GDEVELOPER_A..."],
  "data": 1000000
}
```

**Example â€” 3-payment batch produces 3 events:**

```json
[
  { "topics": ["batch_distribute", "GDEV_A..."], "data": 1000000 },
  { "topics": ["batch_distribute", "GDEV_B..."], "data": 2000000 },
  { "topics": ["batch_distribute", "GDEV_C..."], "data": 500000  }
]
```

> `batch_distribute` is atomic â€” either all payments succeed and all events are
> emitted, or none are. Indexers can verify atomicity by checking that all events
> share the same ledger sequence number.

## Contract: `callora-settlement` (v0.1.0)

Source: [`contracts/settlement/src/lib.rs`](contracts/settlement/src/lib.rs).

**Amount units.** All `amount` / `new_balance` fields are `i128` in USDC
micro-units (7-decimal scaled integers), matching the Stellar USDC contract.
Legacy text elsewhere in this document calls this "stroops" â€” same scalar type,
same integer semantics; the settlement contract never handles native XLM.

**Data payload encoding.** The `data` column describes the Soroban
`contracttype` struct published by `env.events().publish(...)`. On the wire
each struct is a single XDR value whose field names match the Rust struct;
the JSON examples below are the logical field view an indexer sees after
decoding, not a raw array. The struct layouts live in `lib.rs`:
`PaymentReceivedEvent` and `BalanceCreditedEvent`.

**Emit atomicity and ordering.** Both events originate inside one
`receive_payment()` call, so they share the same transaction and ledger
sequence. When `to_pool = false`, `payment_received` is always emitted
**before** `balance_credited`. If any guard panics (see "Panic modes" below)
no events are emitted and state is rolled back.

**Panic modes (no events emitted).**
- Caller is not the registered vault or admin (`require_authorized_caller`).
- `amount <= 0` â€” `"amount must be positive"`.
- `to_pool = true` with `developer = Some(_)` â€” `"developer address must be None when to_pool=true"`.
- `to_pool = false` with `developer = None` â€” `"developer address required when to_pool=false"`.
- Arithmetic overflow on pool or developer balance â€” `"pool balance overflow"` / `"developer balance overflow"`.

---

### `payment_received`

Emitted by `receive_payment()` for every successful inbound payment,
regardless of routing.

| Index        | Location | Type              | Description                                                                       |
|--------------|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| topic 0      | topics   | Symbol            | `"payment_received"`                                                              |
| topic 1      | topics   | Address           | `caller` â€” authorized vault or admin address (same as `from_vault` field)         |
| `from_vault` | data     | Address           | originator of the payment; duplicates topic 1 for indexers that key by data only  |
| `amount`     | data     | i128              | payment amount in USDC micro-units; invariant `amount > 0`                        |
| `to_pool`    | data     | bool              | `true` â†’ credited to global pool; `false` â†’ credited to an individual developer   |
| `developer`  | data     | Option\<Address\> | `None` when `to_pool = true`; `Some(address)` when `to_pool = false`              |

**Example â€” global pool credit (`to_pool = true`):**

```json
{
  "topics": ["payment_received", "GCALLER..."],
  "data": {
    "from_vault": "GCALLER...",
    "amount": 5000000,
    "to_pool": true,
    "developer": null
  }
}
```

Side effect: `GlobalPool.total_balance += amount` and
`GlobalPool.last_updated = env.ledger().timestamp()`.

**Example â€” developer credit (`to_pool = false`):**

```json
{
  "topics": ["payment_received", "GCALLER..."],
  "data": {
    "from_vault": "GCALLER...",
    "amount": 2500000,
    "to_pool": false,
    "developer": "GDEV..."
  }
}
```

Side effect: developer balance map entry for `GDEV...` is incremented by
`amount`. `GlobalPool.last_updated` is **not** touched on developer credits.

**Indexer guidance.**
- `topic 1` is always the caller; filter on it to isolate payments from a
  specific vault or admin.
- `developer` is the only field that distinguishes pool vs. developer credits
  in the data payload; the `to_pool` boolean is redundant but stable and
  cheaper to filter on.
- A `payment_received` with `to_pool = false` is always paired with exactly
  one `balance_credited` event in the same transaction.

---

### `balance_credited`

Emitted by `receive_payment()` **only** when `to_pool = false`, immediately
after the matching `payment_received` event.

| Index         | Location | Type    | Description                                                     |
|---------------|----------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| topic 0       | topics   | Symbol  | `"balance_credited"`                                            |
| topic 1       | topics   | Address | `developer` â€” address whose balance was updated                 |
| `developer`   | data     | Address | same as topic 1; duplicated for data-only indexers              |
| `amount`      | data     | i128    | amount credited to the developer in USDC micro-units            |
| `new_balance` | data     | i128    | developer's cumulative balance after this credit (post-state)   |

```json
{
  "topics": ["balance_credited", "GDEV..."],
  "data": {
    "developer": "GDEV...",
    "amount": 2500000,
    "new_balance": 7500000
  }
}
```

**Invariants.**
- `new_balance = prior_balance + amount`, checked for `i128` overflow; overflow
  panics and rolls back both events.
- `new_balance` equals `CalloraSettlement::get_developer_balance(developer)`
  immediately after the emitting transaction.
- `amount` in `balance_credited` equals `amount` in the paired
  `payment_received`.

**Indexer guidance.**
- Track developer earnings by subscribing to `balance_credited` â€” it already
  carries the post-credit balance, so no separate read is required.
- Track total protocol inflow by summing `payment_received.amount` across
  both routing modes, or filter `to_pool = true` for pool-only inflow.
- `balance_credited` is **never** emitted when `to_pool = true`; do not wait
  for one on pool credits.

### `vault_changed`

Emitted by `set_vault()` when the admin updates the registered vault address.

| Index   | Location | Type    | Description                        |
|---------|----------|---------|------------------------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol  | `"vault_changed"`                |
| topic 1 | topics   | Address | `caller` — admin who performed update |
| data    | data     | (Address, Address) | (old_vault, new_vault)        |

```json
{
  "topics": ["vault_changed", "GADMIN..."],
  "data": ["GOLDVAULT...", "GNEWVAULT..."]
}
```

---

### `allowlist_add`

Emitted when the owner adds an address to the depositor allowlist.

| Index   | Location | Type    | Description              |
|---------|----------|---------|--------------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol  | `"allowlist_add"`        |
| topic 1 | topics   | Address | caller (owner)           |
| topic 2 | topics   | Address | depositor being added    |
| data    | data     | ()      | empty                    |

```json
{
  "topics": ["allowlist_add", "GOWNER...", "GDEPOSITOR..."],
  "data": null
}
```

**Indexer note:** If the address was already in the list, the event is still emitted
but the list is unchanged (no duplicates are stored).

---

### `allowlist_clear`

Emitted when the owner wipes the entire depositor allowlist.

| Index   | Location | Type    | Description      |
|---------|----------|---------|------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol  | `"allowlist_clear"` |
| topic 1 | topics   | Address | caller (owner)   |
| data    | data     | ()      | empty            |

```json
{
  "topics": ["allowlist_clear", "GOWNER..."],
  "data": null
}
```

**Indexer note:** After this event, `get_allowlist()` returns an empty list.
All previously allowed depositor addresses must be re-added via `add_address()`.

---

### `price_set`

Emitted when the owner sets or updates the price for an offering.

| Index   | Location | Type    | Description                        |
|---------|-----------|---------|------------------------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol  | `"price_set"`                      |
| topic 1 | topics   | Address | caller (owner)                     |
| topic 2 | topics   | String  | `offering_id`                      |
| data    | data     | String  | price as a decimal string (i128)   |

```json
{
  "topics": ["price_set", "GOWNER...", "offering-001"],
  "data": "5000000"
}
```

**Encoding note:** The price is stored and emitted as a UTF-8 decimal string
representing a positive `i128` integer in USDC micro-units. A value of `"0"` or
negative is rejected before the event is emitted.

---

### `upgraded`

Emitted when the admin upgrades the contract WASM via `upgrade()`.
Emitted by both the vault and revenue pool contracts.

| Index   | Location | Type        | Description                        |
|---------|----------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol      | `"upgraded"`                       |
| topic 1 | topics   | Address     | `admin` — address that triggered the upgrade |
| data    | data     | BytesN<32>  | new WASM hash installed on-chain   |

```json
{
  "topics": ["upgraded", "GADMIN..."],
  "data": "<32-byte WASM hash as hex>"
}
```

**Indexer note:** The emitted hash matches what `version()` returns immediately
after the upgrade. Indexers can use this event to track contract version history
without querying ledger state.

---

## Contract: `callora-revenue-pool` — additional events

### `pause_set`

Emitted by both `pause()` and `unpause()`. The boolean data field distinguishes
the two cases, making this a single unified event for pause state changes.

| Index   | Location | Type    | Description                            |
|---------|----------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| topic 0 | topics   | Symbol  | `"pause_set"`                          |
| topic 1 | topics   | Address | `caller` — admin who changed the state |
| data    | data     | bool    | `true` = paused, `false` = unpaused    |

```json
{ "topics": ["pause_set", "GADMIN..."], "data": true }
```

```json
{ "topics": ["pause_set", "GADMIN..."], "data": false }
```

**Indexer note:** After `data = true`, `distribute()` and `batch_distribute()`
are blocked. After `data = false`, all operations are restored.
Calling `pause()` when already paused, or `unpause()` when not paused, panics
before the event is emitted.

---

## Contract: `callora-settlement` — additional events

### `developer_withdraw`

Emitted when a developer withdraws their accrued balance from the settlement contract.

| Index              | Location | Type    | Description                                    |
|--------------------|----------|---------|------------------------------------------------|
| topic 0            | topics   | Symbol  | `"developer_withdraw"`                         |
| topic 1            | topics   | Address | `developer` — address initiating the withdrawal |
| `developer`        | data     | Address | same as topic 1; duplicated for data-only indexers |
| `amount`           | data     | i128    | amount withdrawn in USDC micro-units           |
| `remaining_balance`| data     | i128    | developer's balance after the withdrawal       |

```json
{
  "topics": ["developer_withdraw", "GDEV..."],
  "data": {
    "developer": "GDEV...",
    "amount": 2500000,
    "remaining_balance": 1000000
  }
}
```

**Invariant:** `remaining_balance = prior_balance − amount`. The USDC transfer
to `developer` has already succeeded by the time this event is emitted — the
funds have left the contract.

---

### `vault_proposed`

Emitted when the admin proposes a new vault address via `propose_vault()`.
This begins a two-step vault rotation; the vault is not active until
`vault_accepted` is emitted.

| Index            | Location | Type    | Description                              |
|------------------|----------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| topic 0          | topics   | Symbol  | `"vault_proposed"`                       |
| topic 1          | topics   | Address | `caller` — admin who initiated the proposal |
| `current_vault`  | data     | Address | the vault address currently registered   |
| `proposed_vault` | data     | Address | the new vault address pending acceptance |

```json
{
  "topics": ["vault_proposed", "GADMIN..."],
  "data": {
    "current_vault": "GOLDVAULT...",
    "proposed_vault": "GNEWVAULT..."
  }
}
```

**Indexer note:** Until `vault_accepted` is observed, `current_vault` remains
the active vault for `receive_payment()` authorization. Index this event to
monitor pending rotations.

---

### `vault_accepted`

Emitted when the pending vault (or admin) accepts the proposed vault rotation
via `accept_vault()`. After this event the new vault is the only address
authorized to call `receive_payment()`.

| Index        | Location | Type    | Description                                         |
|--------------|----------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| topic 0      | topics   | Symbol  | `"vault_accepted"`                                  |
| topic 1      | topics   | Address | `caller` — pending vault or admin who accepted      |
| `old_vault`  | data     | Address | vault address that was previously active            |
| `new_vault`  | data     | Address | vault address now active                            |
| `accepted_by`| data     | Address | same as topic 1; duplicated for data-only indexers  |

```json
{
  "topics": ["vault_accepted", "GNEWVAULT..."],
  "data": {
    "old_vault": "GOLDVAULT...",
    "new_vault": "GNEWVAULT...",
    "accepted_by": "GNEWVAULT..."
  }
}
```

**Indexer note:** After this event, update any cached vault address used for
payment-source filtering. `vault_proposed` + `vault_accepted` always appear as
a pair across two separate transactions.
